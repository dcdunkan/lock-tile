## lock-tile
A quick settings tile for locking the screen for those who does not have this tile.

I tried several open & closed applications for this functionality. Either they
had a lot of unwanted functions which required more permissions and storage or they had 
a home screen icon and activity: I don't want a home screen icon and activity just for a tile.
There may be apps that fits my need, but I couldn't find it :(

So, I made one that fits all my needs, and one that I can extend anytime I want.
My first Android application, probably have made a lot of mistakes as I referenced parts of other
android app sources.

#### Features

- No app icon or activity: less clutter.
- 93KB in size.
- Long living physical buttons. (yeah)

#### Usage

- Build and install the app. Or if you trust me enough, download the one that I built from releases.
- Go to your device's Settings > Accessibility > Lock Tile > Enable the service.
- Draw your quick settings panel, go to edit mode and drag the tile named "Lock Screen" provided by this app to a position that you like.
- Drag down your quick settings panel and click the tile to lock the screen!
